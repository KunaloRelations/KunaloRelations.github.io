Show-stopping bugs in Apple Xcode plague the otherwise nice developer tool.  Apple needs to step up hardware support and testing.

  Although I've been using Mac OS X for many years, I've never used Xcode. &nbsp;I normally use Emacs on Linux Ubuntu at
  home to teach my son Python. &nbsp;He's using Komodo on Ubuntu. &nbsp;When we are on vacation, he uses Komodo on Mac
  and I use Emacs on Mac.<br/><br/>As I was getting ready for our trip to Hawaii, I decided to update my GitHub
  repositories on my MacBook Pro so that my son could continue to develop his games on vacation.<br/><br/>Since Git
  doesn't install by default on the Mac, I decided to install Xcode and the Apple command line tools.<br/><br/>I was
  really surprised at the large number of low reviews and complaints about Xcode.<br/>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Since there are a number of 5 star ratings, I have to
    assume that the product itself is good and that there are some showstopper bugs which results in many 1 star
    ratings. &nbsp;</div>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I've used Apple products extensively and found the Apple
    hardware and OS to be of high quality. &nbsp;It's surprising that the company is shipping their Xcode product with
    some critical bugs.&nbsp;</div>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">While Apple is working on Xcode, Google is working with
    on Android Studio with JetBrains. &nbsp;The new Android Studio is based on the IntelliJ IDEA, not Eclipse. &nbsp;Currently,
    it's on version 0.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I wasn't able to install Xcode on my three year old
    MacBook Pro.&nbsp; From reading the comments on the AppStore, this is a common problem.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it has
    anything to do with my running Mac OS X Mavericks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The good news is that I was able to install the Apple
    Command Line Tools with no problems.&nbsp; The Apple Command Line Tools installs git and I can now move things back
    and forth with github easily.
  </div>
  <br/>I was also able to install XQuartz http://xquartz.macosforge.org with no problem and can run the applications
  that I need.<br/><br/>Despite the problem with Xcode installation, I don't think it will affect me over the Christmas
  holiday. &nbsp; I'll try and install the tools I need on my wife's MacBook Air 11" which has the new Haswell Core i5
  CPU in it with Intel HD Graphics 5000.&nbsp; That should be able to run everything fine.<br/><br/>Gigi Read just
  bought an even better computer, the MacBook Air 13" with 8 gig of memory.&nbsp; That's a really nice machine.&nbsp; I
  may end up picking one up in 2014.&nbsp; In the meantime, I'm plodding forward with my old 2010 MacBook Pro, a new
  Windows 8 notebook, and my main Linux desktop machine at home.
