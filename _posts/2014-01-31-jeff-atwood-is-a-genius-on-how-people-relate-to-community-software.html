afternoon east of the San Francisco Bay, I stopped my spoon of clam chowder in mid-air as I sat across the cafe lunch table from Jeff Atwood, the co-founder of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> and the founder of <a href="http://www.discourse.org/" target="_blank">Discourse</a>. <br /><br />Jeff was explaining to me the basics of online trust and how to encourage people to protect the best interests of the community. &nbsp;Unlike many programmers, Jeff started off with a discussion on sociology.<br /><br />This surprised me since he is famous for creating the bad-ass Stack Overflow site that is the number one place for developers to get technical information. &nbsp;The Stack Exchange network he built gets a beefy 150 million page views a month. &nbsp;His blog, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" target="_blank">Coding Horror</a> get 70,000 page views a month from developers. &nbsp;He's an uber programmer that also happens to know more about sociology and human factors than I, a single-dimensional, supposedly liberal arts savvy, marketing guy.<br /><br />I had come to lunch to learn about the future of online forums and perhaps gain a glimpse into the secret of Stack Overflow's success. &nbsp;Although there was the obligatory techie talk about JavaScript, the <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> library that Discourse uses, and single sign-on strategies, the real "holy crap" parts of the discussion dealt with how Jeff debugs human behavior online. <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If people are obnoxious online, is it because they haven't been reminded of proper manners prior to posting?</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">If people are ranting in low-value flaming posts, is it because they haven't read enough background information?</blockquote>I came to realize that Stack Overflow has such high-value responses because Jeff used technology to help shape efficient question and answer discussions. <br /><br />In world with a plethora of data analysts sifting through big data streams, it was exciting and a bit mystifying that some of the analysis for best features came from Jeff going online and manually checking out human behavior then using technology and system data to debug the human behavior problem.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.discourse.org/about/">vision of Discourse</a> is awfully compelling for an old-school community guy like me that loved online discussion software prior to 1994, then disliked it for the next 20 years. &nbsp;To me, it seemed like the quality of forum software went downhill as things moved to the Web.<br /><br />Jeff and the team at Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc. hope to be the stewards of a new generation of forum software. &nbsp;It will be a tough road. &nbsp;It's not immediately obvious to a casual user how Discourse is different from something like Drupal, phpBB, and vBulletin. <br /><br />With Jeff Atwood steering a course of human behavior debugging, I'm optimistic about the future of not only Discourse, but forum software in general.<br /><br />Five Things I Remember About Discourse<br /><br /><ol><li>Optimized for mobile devices and the way people read and type on mobile devices;</li><li>Can be integrated with WordPress blogs to form a community around a blog or set of blogs;</li><li>Entire page is JavaScript to allow display on any device. &nbsp;No need for native apps on the phone or tablet;</li><li>Allows branching of a topic, a type of discussion I enjoyed in the past;</li><li>Open source and hosted version available now.</li></ol><div><br /></div>Jeff recommended the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183613">The Honest Truth about Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone -- Especially Ourselves</a>, by Dan Ariely, to get a better understanding of human behaviour and online people to people interaction.<br /><br />Check out Discourse.<br /><ol><li>It's free and open source. &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse" target="_blank">Get it on GitHub</a></li><li><a href="http://www.discourse.org/buy/" target="_blank">Buy it hosted from Civilized Discourse Construction Kit</a>, the company Jeff Atwood founded. &nbsp;Despite what the web site says, Jeff assured me that people can buy it. &nbsp;The web site is set up to discourage the casual, clueless buyer, not you and me. &nbsp;:-)</li><li>Buy it hosted from a community site such as <a href="https://www.discoursehosting.com/" target="_blank">Discourse Hosting</a>&nbsp;for $20/month, unaffiliated with Jeff Atwood.</li><li>Numerous sites already using it: <a href="http://discuss.howtogeek.com/" target="_blank">How-To Geek</a>, <a href="http://bbs.boingboing.net/"

James, thank you for your valuable and insightful comment.<br /><br />I agree with your points.  Jeff Atwood isn&#39;t perfect.  Discourse and Stack Overflow have flaws.<br /><br />Jeff is a good programmer that takes the time to analyze human behavior.  He cares how people use his software.  I admire that.  Too many people don&#39;t care enough.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if his model is scalable.  Obviously, he&#39;s one guy with limited time and a family to attend to.  However, I wanted to call out that great ideas and features sometimes come from the plodding hard work of paying attention to how people use the software.  There is an art to separate the gmes from the noise.  <br /><br />Building a community is hard.  Discourse may fail.  Most community software has failed.  We&#39;re left with things like Drupal and phpBB that are okay, but could be so much more.  <br /><br />Twenty years ago, I was passionate about the online community and community software.  After the economic bubble popped in 2002, I gave up on community software and in many ways community curation.  I became a specialist in tech promotion and built a successful business.  <br /><br />The embers of my belief in the community never fully went out.  When I get comments from guys like you, I&#39;m reminded of the enormous potential and value of the community.  It is hard to build a community.  Most people give up.<br /><br />It is hard.  Most communities fail.  Most, but not all.  Jeff hasn&#39;t given up and I don&#39;t think you have either.<br /><br />I salute the both of you.<br /><br />I too am eager to see where Discourse and Stack Overflow lead to in 10 years.<br /><br />Thanks again and I look forward to hearing more from you.<br /></div>

I really like Discourse, Jeff Atwood is unquestionably very talented, and he definitely has a very good grip on how people work and act and designs software accordingly. He&#39;s worthy of a lot of praise. It should be said though, that I don&#39;t think he&#39;s perfect.<br /><br />That&#39;s he&#39;s able to do it repeatedly and in a high quality way is awesome. But is what he&#39;s created really sustainable? Is the culture permanent or in decline Building up a community is one thing that&#39;s incredibly difficult. Most people have difficulty doing it. They build a social network or a blog or some forum and try and unite a culture around it. It rarely works well. That&#39;s when most people really &quot;give up&quot; trying to build a community and work on seo tricks or using the types of companies listed at <a href="http://www.buyfacebookfansreviews.com" rel="nofollow">BuyFacebookFansReviews.com</a> to try and go &quot;viral&quot; on social media, whatever that means, rather than focusing on the core culture and interface with the community.<br /><br />Just to explain my point about the decline of culture and then go more into Jeff Atwood, Wikipedia started out in an amazing way and then got progressively more bureaucratic and controlled by by power hungry editors who did everything they could to stifle discussion and limit the number of topics that could be discussed.<br /><br />StackOverflow is still generally pretty awesome, but there are many great conversations and discussions shut down prematurely by mods who are seemingly going down the same path as Wikipedia. And the points system and chosen answer system incentivizes many quick answers being created rather than crafting in-depth posts on a topic.<br /><br />Due to the subreddit system, Reddit is one of the only websites that I can think of that is still completely awesome in just about every way imaginable. Lots of subreddits turn to poop, but new ones are continuously formed. Even stuff like 4chan, despite its advantages, have declined in some ways culturally from where it was.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to see where Stackoverflow and Discourse is a decade from now. Hopefully the culture and high quality will be mostly intact, but that&#39;s one part of the equation that I think is very difficult and underrated.</div>
