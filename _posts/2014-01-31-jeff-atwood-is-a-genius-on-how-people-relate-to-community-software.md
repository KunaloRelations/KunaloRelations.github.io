On a sunny Friday afternoon east of the San Francisco Bay, I stopped my spoon of clam chowder in mid-air as I sat
across the cafe lunch table from Jeff Atwood, the co-founder of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack
Overflow</a> and the founder of <a href="http://www.discourse.org/" target="_blank">Discourse</a>. Jeff was
explaining to me the basics of online trust and how to encourage people to protect the best interests of the
community. Unlike many programmers, Jeff started off with a discussion on sociology.

This surprised me
since he is famous for creating the bad-ass Stack Overflow site that is the number one place for developers to get
technical information. The Stack Exchange network he built gets a beefy 150 million page views a month. His
blog, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" target="_blank">Coding Horror</a> get 70,000 page views a month from
developers. He's an uber programmer that also happens to know more about sociology and human factors than I, a
single-dimensional, supposedly liberal arts savvy, marketing guy.I had come to lunch to learn about the
future of online forums and perhaps gain a glimpse into the secret of Stack Overflow's success. Although there
was the obligatory techie talk about JavaScript, the <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> library that Discourse
uses, and single sign-on strategies, the real "holy crap" parts of the discussion dealt with how Jeff debugs human
behavior online.


<blockquote class="tr_bq">If people are obnoxious online, is it because they haven't been reminded of proper manners
prior to posting?
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">If people are ranting in low-value flaming posts, is it because they haven't read enough
background information?
</blockquote>

I came to realize that Stack Overflow has such high-value responses because Jeff used technology to help shape
efficient question and answer discussions. In world with a plethora of data analysts sifting through big
data streams, it was exciting and a bit mystifying that some of the analysis for best features came from Jeff going
online and manually checking out human behavior then using technology and system data to debug the human behavior
problem.The <a href="http://www.discourse.org/about/">vision of Discourse</a> is awfully compelling for an
old-school community guy like me that loved online discussion software prior to 1994, then disliked it for the next 20
years. To me, it seemed like the quality of forum software went downhill as things moved to the Web.Jeff
and the team at Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc. hope to be the stewards of a new generation of forum
software. It will be a tough road. It's not immediately obvious to a casual user how Discourse is
different from something like Drupal, phpBB, and vBulletin. With Jeff Atwood steering a course of human
behavior debugging, I'm optimistic about the future of not only Discourse, but forum software in general.Five

Jeff recommended the book, <a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183613">The Honest Truth
about Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone -- Especially Ourselves</a>, by Dan Ariely, to get a better understanding of
human behaviour and online people to people interaction.Check out Discourse.
<ol>
<li>It's free and open source. <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse" target="_blank">Get it on
  GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.discourse.org/buy/" target="_blank">Buy it hosted from Civilized Discourse Construction
  Kit</a>, the company Jeff Atwood founded. Despite what the web site says, Jeff assured me that people can
  buy it. The web site is set up to discourage the casual, clueless buyer, not you and me. :-)

<li>Buy it hosted from a community site such as <a href="https://www.discoursehosting.com/" target="_blank">Discourse
  Hosting</a>for $20/month, unaffiliated with Jeff Atwood.
