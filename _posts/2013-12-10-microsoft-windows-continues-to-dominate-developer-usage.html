  In order to get a better idea of what platforms developers were using to create great software, I looked at different
  sources of data.<br/><br/>My first source was the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/"><span id="goog_1424136792"></span>Net
  Market Share</a>&nbsp;desktop OS market share data from November, 2013.<br/><br/>

          imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0"
                                                                            src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V1dIMjeaoJU/UqeS0AmyxVI/AAAAAAAAABs/Il3FgB2avRA/s1600/november_desktop_marketshare.png"/></a>

  This data indicates that Windows accounts for 90.73% of users. &nbsp;Mac OS X accounts for 4.27% of users. &nbsp;The
  Linux data is available on the Net Market Share site. &nbsp;Linux accounts for 1.56% of users.<br/><br/>To get a
  better idea of developers, I looked at the <a
        href="http://www.slideshare.net/IanSkerrett/eclipse-survey-2013-report-final" target="_blank">Eclipse Community
  Survey Report from June 2013</a>.<br/><br/>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a
          href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xCO6eABS0iw/UqeUt36xeDI/AAAAAAAAAB4/Fs_6EklIM8A/s1600/eclispe_os_as_primary_development_platform.png"
          imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0"
                                                                            src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xCO6eABS0iw/UqeUt36xeDI/AAAAAAAAAB4/Fs_6EklIM8A/s1600/eclispe_os_as_primary_development_platform.png"/></a>
  </div>
  <br/>This indicates that Windows is used by 55% of software developers as their primary platform for software
  development. &nbsp;Linux is a strong second with 35%. &nbsp;Mac OS X trails significantly behind with 8.7% of
  developers in the 2013 survey. &nbsp; &nbsp;Note that in the most recent survey, Linux gained at the expense of Mac OS
  X.<br/><br/>The reasons for the lack of popularity of Mac OS X for software developers using Eclipse became apparent
  when I looked at the target platform for deployment.<br/><br/>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br/></div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Windows is still used as the primary operating system
    for deployment. &nbsp;</div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br/></div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The software developers were primarily developing
    software and hardware high-tech products.

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br/></div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The results are more skewed toward Java developers.
    &nbsp;Of the respondents, 67% were developing on Java and 11% were developing on C/C++.
  </div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br/></div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The <a
          href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html" target="_blank">TIOBE Programming
    Community Index</a> for December 2013 shows that C is used by 17.9% of developers and Java is used by 17.3%. &nbsp;Adding
    up the developers of C, Objective-C, and C++, the total "C family" developers is over 37%.
  </div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br/></div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The Eclipse Foundation report doesn't give a full view
    of all developers. &nbsp;It focuses primarily on professional Java developers building products for software and
    hardware vendors.
  </div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br/></div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">To get another view of Python programmers, I looked at
    the traffic to my blog on teaching Python programming. &nbsp;The blog is focused heavily on basic coding techniques.
    &nbsp;The top traffic referral is Stackoverflow.&nbsp;</div>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Among people learning or teaching Python programming,
    59% use Windows. &nbsp; Although the blog doesn't cover Java development, the results are skewed toward people with
    Android phones since many of the lessons cover using Python with Pygame, and Pygame Subset for Android to get Python
    applications running on Android.

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br/></div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I have been trying to grab OS usage from either GitHub
    or StackOverflow directly. &nbsp;If anyone knows how to do this, please leave a comment on this blog.

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Other sources of data.</div>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/" target="_blank">Steam Platform Survey</a>. &nbsp;This is
      obviously skewed heavily toward Windows since almost all games run on Windows and only a small percentage run on
      Linux and Mac OS X. &nbsp;Even with this limitation, the Steam survey is useful in showing that if a person is
      trying to reach a desktop computer games developer, you need to target Windows developers. &nbsp;If you're
      developing for Microsoft XBox, you're probably using Microsoft Windows.

         target="_blank">Android versus iOS market share</a>. &nbsp; The iPhone has a huge impact on developer
      platforms. &nbsp;Although Android is the dominant mobile platform, iOS has more gamers using it. &nbsp;If you're
      developing a game for the iPhone, the developer is probably using Mac OS X. &nbsp;</li>
