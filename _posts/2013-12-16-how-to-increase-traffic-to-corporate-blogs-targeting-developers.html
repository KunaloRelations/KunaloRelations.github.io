Marketing activities to get more traffic blogs targeting software developers  
  
{{excerpt_separator}}

<hr>

After working on corporate blog and social promotion campaigns for Appcelerator, Cisco, Google, McAfee, SAP, and
  VMware, I developed a list of best practices to drive traffic to B2B technology blogs. &nbsp;These practices were
  developed by working with large, global tech brands.<br/><br/>The results are listed by ROI, best to least
  effective.<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>SEO;</li>
    <li>Cross-promotion with other channels such as Facebook;</li>
    <li>Social media advertising on Twitter, LinkedIn;</li>
    <li>Physical event interaction such as taking pictures and videos at a trade show and putting them up on the
      corporate blog or onsite Twitter reporting;
    </li>
    <li>Other campaigns such as surveys, contests, chats.</li>
  </ol>
  <div>The results are definitely impacted by the existing campaigns, which are constantly running at large, global
    companies. &nbsp;A campaign like SEO is also reliant upon content generation. &nbsp;Marketing and developer
    relations campaigns are now very interconnected. &nbsp;</div>
  <div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"/>To zoom in on the results of content generation and community interaction
    for software developers, I decided to run some experiments on a smaller scale for Python developer blogs. &nbsp; <a
            href="http://pychildren.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">I created a blog to teach children to program in
      Python</a> and analyzed the referral traffic for six months.&nbsp;</div>
  <div><br/></div>
  In order to control my experiment results, I limited my promotional activities to online interaction with other
  developers.&nbsp; I also focused on Python developers with a very narrow scope.&nbsp; I am only targeting parents that
  are teaching their children to program in Python. &nbsp;The blog and videos are averaging 4,000 views a month, which
  is a reasonable set of data, especially considering the very narrow scope of the Python for children (<a
        href="http://pychildren.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">PyChildren</a>) topic.<br/><br/>For this experiment, the
  top referring URLs in order to effectiveness are:<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>Stackoverflow question and answer about using Android Debugger on Linux and finding the vendor ID of the
      Rockwell RK3066 chipset used in Android tablets.&nbsp; A complete stranger posted a link to my blog as the answer
      to a Stackoverflow question.&nbsp; This is the largest source of traffic by far.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Other Python blogs where I posted a question or an answer that linked back to my blog.</li>
    <li>Forum on Pygame Subset for Android development. (I posted the answer and link)</li>
    <li>YouTube video on creating JSON mapfiles with Tiled (I created the video)</li>
    <li>YouTube video on 2D sprite animation (I created the video)</li>
  </ol>
  The top search keyword is the name of my blog pychildren.blogspot.com. &nbsp; &nbsp;The other keywords are deal with
  using the library, pygame, that I describe how to use.<br/><br/>Top keywords for organic search in order of
  effectiveness are:<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>pygame alternatives</li>
    <li>pygame and android</li>
    <li>pygame gamepad</li>
    <li>pygame examples</li>
  </ol>
  From this data, I drew the following conclusions:<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>Stackoverflow is in a category by itself.&nbsp; It was the most effective.</li>
    <li>Other community blogs targeting developers</li>
    <li>Forums targeting developers</li>
    <li>Most viewers are looking for information on how to use the pygame library or they are making a decision on
      whether to use the pygame library or an alternative.
    </li>
  </ol>
  From my previous experience with a full set of services, I know that targeting developers usually involves a mix of
  advertising, public relations, and social media.
