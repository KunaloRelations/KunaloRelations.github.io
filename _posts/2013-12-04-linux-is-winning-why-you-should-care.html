excerpt: Linux is dominant in most areas, from servers to mobile phone.  More important than the business of Linux is the philosophy of sharing that it is based on.

  For the last twenty years, my wife and I have rode the highs and lows of the open source movement. Despite the massive
  impact open source businesses have had on our lives, my wife, like most people, has little interest in the philosophy
  and business dynamics of open source.&nbsp; Over the last two decades of listening to my ramblings, she appreciates
  that open source has something to do with the philosophy of sharing and doing the right thing, regardless of the
  rewards. <br/><br/>As we drank coffee after breakfast, I made several points to her:<br/><br/>
  <ul>
    <li>Linux has absolutely succeeded in the last 15 years since my wife and I owned over a million shares of
      Turbolinux stock.&nbsp; Though we never made money from that business venture, the main part of our journey was a
      religious belief that Linux would one day be bigger than Microsoft Windows.
    </li>
    <li>Open source businesses are now hugely successful, with a proliferation of business models.</li>
  </ul>
  &nbsp;She politely listened to me and made no comment.&nbsp;&nbsp; She understands that the most popular Linux
  distribution is Google Android, an OS that has more market share than iOS and is rapidly eroding&nbsp; the PC market.&nbsp;
  I'm not sure she knew that her Kindle was a Linux computer.&nbsp; She definitely didn't know that on the Amazon Best
  Sellers list of laptops, the top two laptops are Linux laptops, the Samsung Chromebook 11.6 inch for $165 and the HP
  Chromebook 11 for $279.&nbsp; Of the top six laptops on the Amazon Best Sellers list, four of the laptops are
  Linux.<br/><br/>My wife and I started down the Linux path in 1994 with Slackware and floppy disks.&nbsp; Although she
  didn't use Linux herself, her apartment in Tokyo quickly became filled with computer parts and systems in various
  working states.&nbsp; Since that time, Linux has grown to absolutely dominate server operating systems.&nbsp; There's
  no question that Linux dominates the HPC market and is the primary OS of the Internet, used by companies like Google,
  Amazon and Facebook for their infrastructure.<br/><br/>Linux won on the servers, is winning on mobile phones and shows
  new life on low-end laptops. So what?<br/><br/>Why is it important for Linux to win?<br/><br/>Open source is filled
  with characters like Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman that have a belief that sharing is a good thing.&nbsp; Many
  open source people believe so strongly in this philosophy that they'll pursue careers that aren't particularly
  lucrative in order to do what they believe is right.<br/><br/>We're at an exciting time in open source business
  models.&nbsp; Restrictive licenses like the GPL that force sharing are losing in popularity to more open licenses like
  the Apache license that encourage businesses to create proprietary extensions to an open core.&nbsp; Although I'm a
  bit concerned by this trend, I haven't taken a position on it yet.<br/><br/>As the coffee chat with my wife wound
  down, I explained five open source business models to her:<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>Everything open.&nbsp; Sell support and services for licensed software only.&nbsp; This is what Red Hat pursued.&nbsp;
      They are now valued at over eight billion dollars and have more than one billion dollars in sales.
    </li>
    <li>Open core with closed extensions.&nbsp; Sell support for licensed software with proprietary extensions that
      provide improved functionality for businesses.&nbsp; This is what Turbolinux, the company I helped to build,
      pursued.&nbsp;&nbsp; We failed.&nbsp; Other companies like Cloudera are successful with it.
    </li>
    <li>Hardware.&nbsp; This one took a bit of a twist.&nbsp; Many companies sell Linux hardware. &nbsp;&nbsp; Samsung
      sells Galaxy Android phones and tablets.&nbsp; Amazon sells Kindles.&nbsp; Acer, Asus, and LG all sell Linux
      devices.&nbsp; The twist is that the development of the OS for hardware sales did not follow the model pioneered
      by VA Linux.&nbsp; Instead, Google, an advertising company, led the development of the Android and ChromeOS
      distributions.
    </li>
    <li>Advertising.&nbsp; In an indirect way Google creates Android and ChromeOS to sell more ads.&nbsp; It's not an
      obvious move like Ubuntu did with Ubuntu 12.10.&nbsp; It's also something that we discussed at Turbolinux but
      could never figure out how to to do properly.&nbsp; After seeing what happened to Ubuntu, I don't think we could
      have pulled it off.&nbsp; Google is an expert at selling advertisements and their strategy is highly successful.
    </li>
    <li>Free cloud service.&nbsp; Twitter, Google, and Facebook could not exist without Linux.&nbsp; In many ways,
      Twitter and Facebook are open source Linux companies.&nbsp; Although Google is a more obvious Linux company
      because it develops and distributes Android and ChromeOS, all these types of companies need Linux in order to
      offer their services.&nbsp; Twitter issued this statement about Linux, "Linux and its ability to be heavily
      tweaked are fundamental to our technology infrastructure."
    </li>
  </ol>
  My wife didn't get too excited by all of this.&nbsp; After all, it was never about the money.&nbsp; I think she
  believes in the philosophy of sharing, not like Stallman or Torvalds, but in a general "sharing is good" way that
  everyone feels. <br/><br/>It's in vogue now to talk about how to make money from open source. &nbsp; The Twitter IPO
  has everyone dreaming of millions.&nbsp; The media is focusing in on fame and fortune.<br/><br/>Now is the time to
  promote discussions about the basics again.&nbsp; Let's join together to answer the interesting questions about open
  source.&nbsp; How can open source benefit society the most?&nbsp; What is the "right thing to do," not just for your
  own pocket, but for the next generation of people inhabiting our shared planet?&nbsp;&nbsp; I know these are
  touchy-feeling things, but I also think that the topic of how best to share is much more interesting to discuss than
  the topic of how to make money.<br/><br/>Sharing is the past of open source and the future.
