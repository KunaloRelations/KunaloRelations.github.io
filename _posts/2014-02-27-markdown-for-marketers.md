[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown Wikipedia Entry") is a popular formatting language often used by developers for documentation or to communicate with each other.  It is often used in readme files, blogs, forums, and question and answer sites.

GitHub, reddit, Diaspora, [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/ "Stack Overflow"), and SourceForge use Markdown.  It is also the common format for documentation engines or static web site generators such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll").  

To quickly and cheaply publish useful information to developers, marketers will need to deal with Markdown at some point.  There are many ways to avoid using Markdown, but it seems a good skill to have.

I was drawn into the Markdown editing world by:

Kunalo recently moved our blog over to Jekyll and I'm writing this blog post in Markdown using a graphic editor called [MdCharm](http://www.mdcharm.com/ "MdCharm main site").  It's not quite as easy as writing a press release in MS Word, but it's easier for me than using a text editor like Emacs.

Images are a bit tricky as I haven't figured out how to get them to display properly in the editor.

The images looks fine in a web browser and can be tested on the same computer with Jekyll using 
```$
jekyll --server --auto
```

You can then preview the blog post run through Jekyll at: 
```
http://localhost:4000
```

Mashable compiled a great list of Markdown editors called [78 Tools for Writing and Previewing Markdown](http://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/ "Mashable article on Markdown tools").


There were a number of online editors including:

* Dillinger
* StackEdit
* Mou

People on the Ubuntu Discourse forum pointed me to [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/ "main sublime site") and [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/ "Light Table editor").  Although these look great, I wasn't able to get Light Table to work properly and Sublime is a bit pricey for me.  

For now, MdCharm does the job.
