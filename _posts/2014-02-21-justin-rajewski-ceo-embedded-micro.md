# Blown Away by Super Hardware Hacker

If there were an Olympic medal for hardware hacking, Justin Rajewski, 
the CEO of Embedded Micro, would probably get it.  

While most of us take pride in using a soldering iron, Justin 
started designing circuits and circuit boards in
high school.  By the time he was a student at Stanford University
he was CEO of a fast-growing electronics component company with four
distributors in the US and one in Germany.

Hardware hacking has gone mainstream.  Most of us are familiar with 
the hardware hacking stars Raspberry Pi and Arduino, those platforms
were not challenging enough for Justin.  

He chose to specialize in the more arcane, but rapidly growing
area of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) that enable electronic
designers to completely control the hardware.  People designing
with FPGA talk about almost limitless possibilities of building
any type of digital circuit to accomplish any type of task.

Imagine an automobile hot rodder going from buying engines from Ford
to designing every aspect of their own engine and then building 
it in their shop.
