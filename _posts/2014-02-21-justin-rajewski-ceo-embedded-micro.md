If there were an Olympic medal for hardware hacking, Justin Rajewski, 
the CEO of Embedded Micro, would probably get it.  

While most of us take pride in using a soldering iron, Justin 
started designing circuits and circuit boards in
high school.  By the time he was a student at Stanford University
he was CEO of a fast-growing electronics component company with four
distributors in the US and one in Germany.

Hardware hacking has gone mainstream.  Most of us are familiar with 
the hardware hacking stars Raspberry Pi and Arduino, those platforms
were not challenging enough for Justin.  

He chose to specialize in the more arcane, but rapidly growing
area of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) that enable electronic
designers to completely control the hardware.  People designing
with FPGA talk about almost limitless possibilities of building
any type of digital circuit to accomplish any type of task.

Imagine an automobile hot rodder going from buying engines from Ford
to designing every aspect of their own engine and then building 
it in their shop.

To the project started, Justin built a prototype and put a video up on Kickstarter.  You can see the prototype below with hand-soldered connections.  Wow, the man can definitely use a soldering iron!

Here's a section from the Embedded Micro site that explains Justin's passion for FPGA:

<blockquote>
<p>
You can think of an FPGA as a blank slate. By itself an FPGA does nothing. It is up to you (the designer) to create a configuration file, often called a bit file, for the FPGA. Once loaded the FPGA will behave like the digital circuit you designed!
</p>
<pr>
One of the reasons FPGAs are so awesome is that unlike an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) the circuit design is not set and you can reconfigure an FPGA as many times as you like!

Justin's Mojo Board.  When you were in school, did you manufacture FPGA boards in your dorm room?  I didn't.
