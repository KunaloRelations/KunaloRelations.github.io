Recent changes by Facebook to their Pages algorithm 
dramatically reduces reach of content posted to Facebook Pages.  
Marketers leave for cheaper owned options.

People that subscribe to Facebook Pages now only receive 4% to 6% of the content posted to the group.  This means that a marketer with 1,000 subscribers can only reach a maximum of 60 people per post.  The change was implemented by Facebook in order to incent companies to buy advertising to reach Facebook users.  

Unfortunately, this also kills Facebook Pages as a viable option to host a community.

The following quote from Eat24 sums up the problem with using Facebook Pages as a
community platform.

>"We give you text posts, delicious food photos, coupons, restaurant 
>recommendations… and what do you do in return? You take them and you 
> hide them from all our friends,” 

The [blog post][1] is widely referenced on places such as [WSJ][2].

The knowledge gap for marketers using Facebook is [widely written about][3], with
most marketers thinking that their reach on Facebook is much bigger than 
it actually is.

For companies targeting developers or a technical audience, this problem is even worse because it is unlikely that people are using Facebook to look at technical products, especially things like SDKs.

As data from Twitter and Facebook campaigns start to trickle in, we're seeing a move away
from social media sites like Facebook and Twitter and back to company-owned sites such 
as blogs and forums.  An interesting development is the innovation around blog commenting
options.  Things like [LiveFyre Comments][4] are popping up everywhere and even [Discourse has an
plug-in][5] to use their discussion platform as a blog comment management system.
