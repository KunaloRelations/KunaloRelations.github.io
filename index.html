    <h3 id="funnel">Kunalo Funnel</h3>

    <p>
      The Kunalo Funnel for software adoption is based on a modification of a marketing funnel.
      This type of funnel is often used in a marketing automation systems. Although the layers look similar.
      There are significant differences in how the software adoption funnel operates.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a typical marketing campaign, the engagement is usually some form of online engagement
      such as registration to download a whitepaper. In a software adoption funnel, the engagement
      could be at a hackathon, on the comment section of a code distribution web page, or in a forum. Most
      significantly, the content used to trigger the download is usually a document that contains code examples.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ability to provide great code examples on how to use the software is common problem that marketers have.
      Developers running software adoption campaigns usually run into problems with generating awareness.

    <h3>Craig Oda, Partner</h3>

    <p>
      OK father, struggling fly fisherman, aging and clumsy surfer, crappy Python programmer, pretty good
      marketer. </p>

    <p>Craig's professional career started in October 1994 when, being young and foolish, he got together with his
      buddies to build the first public-access Internet service in Japan, served as president, sold the Internet
      company in Japan to a large US firm, co-founded the Tokyo Linux Users Group, and wrote a book for O'Reilly
      Japan on Japanese support in Linux.</p>

    <p>Craig moved to Silicon Valley in 1998. He's held VP positions at technology companies in product marketing,
      product management, technology partnerships, and public relations. For ten years prior to Kunalo, Craig and
      a friend he met at an open source startup built up a pretty good PR and social media firm that they sold to
      LEWIS PR in 2010.</p>

    <p>
      At Page One PR and LEWIS PR Craig consulted with a number of groups, including: Linux Foundation, PyCon,
      Eclipse Foundation, OpenStack launch, Google I/O launch, VMware vCloud launch, Cisco open source developer
      contest launch, Coverity static source code analysis, Jaspersoft, Couchbase, SAP Developer Network, SAP
      Community Network, Cloudera launch, Sleepycat Software BerkeleyDB. </p>

    <p>
      Craig still uses Linux on his desktop and notebook computers. At this stage, it's not because of any
      technical advantage, but because of the philosophy of sharing. He still uses Emacs for programming, but
      recently started to use PyCharm for Python primarily because he was wasting too much time editing his .emacs
      configuration file.</p>

      platform, including creating developer documentation, tutorials, and videos, and
      organizing hackathons and meetups. Prior to starting Kunalo, Gigi was part of the

    <h3 id="kunalo">What Does Kunalo Mean?</h3>

    <p>KuNalo - The wisdom of ancient gods applied to developer relations</p>

    <p>
      A thousand years ago, four major gods existed in ancient Hawaii.
      Ku was the god of war. Kanaloa was the rebellious master of magic that was cast
      out by the gods. Kane was the god of procreation. Lono was the god of
      agriculture and music.
    </p>

    <p>
      While a good developer relations campaign could definitely benefit from all four gods, we decided to create
      our company name from Ku since he was a fighter and Kanaloa, the rebel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developer relations campaigns are often tough because they exist between marketing and engineering
      development. Sadly, we saw that in many companies, engineering and marketing worked in independent silos,
      often at war with each other for resources. We chose Ku as the first part of our company name because we
      wanted to acknowledge the tension that can exist. Rather than one side winning, Ku will help us to join the
      energies and talent across different groups in an organization.
    </p>

    <p>
      We took the middle part of KaNALOa as a nod to the need to think about things differently.
      Developer relations is evolving rapidly with new tools and techniques developed every month.
      To build successful campaigns, we'll need to learn lessons from the rebels of the world and
      borrow some magic from the ancient gods.
